	Overview
The current method of entering hours for on campus jobs is very outdated and inefficient, the goal of this project is to modernize it and move it to 360.gordon.edu
	Problem Statement
Chris Carlson and Chris Hansen want to replace go.gordon.edu with 360.gordon.edu. This project will be a major step towards achieving that goal. Currently the system to enter one’s hours is very outdated and it makes it difficult to enter one’s hours in an efficient manner. The goal is to have a system that works more efficiently so that students will not complain about it as much. Currently the system requires students to scroll through a list of every minute in the day and select the minute at the start and end of their shift. This value defaults to the current minute no matter what. This is one of many problems with the current system. We all believe that this 			system could be improved in a number of ways such as being able to set shifts that you work regularly and continually change the date. The Chris’s are very excited to work with us to solve this problem, and we all seem to be on the same page about it.
	Customer Maintenance Capability
In the future the 360 team would be in charge of 			maintaining this project.

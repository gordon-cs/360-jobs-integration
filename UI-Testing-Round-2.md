Participant 1 UI 1 Start/end time is nice, much better than previous
since you can go by the hour and minute separately Would like to be able
to enter time by typing it in as well as using calendar/dropdown

UI 2 Didnâ€™t like this layout as much, prefer doing each shift one at a
time

UI 3 Shift over start and end time, take hours worked out and move it
somewhere else Liked the ability to reuse previous shifts and access
past ones

Participant 2 UI 1 Like the dropdown for start/end dates Would also like
to be able to enter time by typing it in as well as using
calendar/dropdown

UI 2 Too much information shown at a time, prefers one shift given to
work with at a time

UI 3 Put calendar where start time was, and make it drop down into the
calendar when you click it Also liked the ability to reuse previous
shifts and access past ones
